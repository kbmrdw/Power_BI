# Power_BI
## Introduction
After learning the fundamentals of POWER BI, I applied the skills I learned to undertake several POWER BI projects. Here are some projects that I have completed.
- [Analyzing Customer Churn](https://github.com/kbmrdw/Power_BI/tree/main/Analyzing%20Customer%20Churn)
- [Analyzing Job Market Data](https://github.com/kbmrdw/Power_BI/tree/main/Analyzing%20Job%20Market%20Data)
- [Healthcare Analytics](https://github.com/kbmrdw/Power_BI/tree/main/Healthcare%20Analytics)

## Analyzing Customer Churn
For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this project, I investigated a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyzed their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. I answered these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.

## Analyzing Job Market Data
In this project, I explored a real-world job posting dataset to uncover insights for a fictional recruitment company called DataSearch. I used Power Query to investigate and clean the data to find out what skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. I then used DAX to build insightful visualizations of your findings. Finally, I brang it all together using everything Power BI has to offer to create a business dashboard so that you can answer questions for the DataSearch team.

## Healthcare Analytics
In this project, I'm acting as a consultant for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat but exploring a real-world dataset. The primary goal is to uncover hospital efficiency insights and make recommendations for change. I conducted an initial exploratory analysis before diving deeper into hospital performance outliers and understanding the factors most influence length of stay and cost per patient discharge.

The steps are as follow:
- Load data and create a data model
- Write DAX functions for data analysis
- Utilize advanced visualizations such as Key Influencers
- Develop a 3-page branded report to share with stakeholders
