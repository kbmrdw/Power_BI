# Power_BI
## Introduction
After learning the fundamentals of POWER BI, I applied the skills I learned to undertake several POWER BI projects. Here are some projects that I have completed.
- [Analyzing Customer Churn](https://github.com/kbmrdw/Power_BI/tree/main/Analyzing%20Customer%20Churn)
- [Analyzing Job Market Data](https://github.com/kbmrdw/Power_BI/tree/main/Analyzing%20Job%20Market%20Data)

## Analyzing Customer Churn
For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this project, I investigated a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyzed their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. I answered these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.

## Analyzing Job Market Data
In this project, I explored a real-world job posting dataset to uncover insights for a fictional recruitment company called DataSearch. I used Power Query to investigate and clean the data to find out what skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. I then used DAX to build insightful visualizations of your findings. Finally, I brang it all together using everything Power BI has to offer to create a business dashboard so that you can answer questions for the DataSearch team.
